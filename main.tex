\begin{abstract}
  We consider a setting where a transaction is made by a single payer
  to a possibly large group of recipients, each receiving only a small
  sum in the order of \$$0.01$. For such small sums transaction fees are
  relatively large even if we consider cryptocurrencies instead of
  bank-based transactions.

  Both payers and recipients are expected to repeatedly take part in
  many transactions, but subsequent transactions of a single payer may
  have different, possibly disjoint, groups of recipients. Also, we
  assume that transactions result from activities carried out in a
  decentralized peer-to-peer network, so we would like to avoid
  solutions relying on any trusted third party. We cannot therefore use
  existing solutions that require a central server or assume that a
  payer makes a series of micropayments to a single recipient (Bitcoin
  micropayment channels).

  Instead, we propose a probabilistic payment scheme in which only one
  recipient randomly chosen from a group of candidates is rewarded in
  a single transaction. Our solution is based on Ethereum and is thus
  decentralized and avoids relying on a trusted third party. In
  particular, we describe an Ethereum smart contract implementing a
  lottery used to reward recipients. In the proposed payment scheme,

Figure~\ref{fig:merkle} shows an example Mekle tree with a distinguished node $n = 010$. Its label $w$, together with labels $w_3$, $w_2$ and $w_1$ are used to compute hashes $h_3, \ldots, h_0$.
